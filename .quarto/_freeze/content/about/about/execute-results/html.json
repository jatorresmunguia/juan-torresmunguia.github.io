Subsequently, at the core of this line of work is the development and use of boosting structured additive regression models to identify and describe the extent to which a set of risk factors are associated with a variable of interest and/or to derive their causal effects.\n\nI often consider diversity aspects such as gender, age, and ethnicity. Whenever possible, I strive to include interactive visualizations of my research findings.\n\n[You can view my full CV here](CVitaeR.pdf)\n\nThank you for passing by!\n",
