    "text": "Abstract\nThis MEAC findings report is based on data from three surveys conducted across the North East of Nigeria from February 2022 to November 2023. These surveys were conducted with unaffiliated community members, ex-associates from different armed groups, and current and ex-affiliates of community security organizations like the CJTF.\nThe report examines the factors driving weapons holding in the North East of Nigeria and determines if former associates of Boko Haram and community security groups are retaining their weapons (or rearming later) in order to strengthen disarmament efforts and reduce armed violence in the region. This report highlights a range of social, civic and victimization factors related to weapons holding. These findings can inform the design and implementation of conflict prevention and disarmament strategies in the North East of Nigeria. This is a joint report containing original data and analysis from MEAC, as well as contributions from UNIDIR’s Conventional Arms and Ammunition Programme and UNIDIR’s Gender and Disarmament Programme. The multi-perspective approach brought to bear for this study is essential for developing a holistic and nuanced understanding of how and why different populations arm themselves and what conditions lead them to lay aside their weapons, questions which have significant implications for the safety and peacebuilding efforts in a region that has long suffered from insurgent violence.\n\n\nCitation\n\nKleffmann, Johanna; Batault, Francesca; Torres Munguía, Juan Armando; O’Neil, Siobhan; Althuis, Jente; Shakur, Mohammed Rabby; Hallahan, Anna; Salama, Hana; Coulibaly, Mohamed (2023).

    "text": "Abstract\nAccording to official poverty estimates in Mexico, more than 50 percent of the population was poor in 2016, half of which could not even afford the basic food basket. Whereas most of the existing research analyses poverty focusing exclusively on average income or on the expected probability of being poor, this paper departs from this approach by analyzing income differences between households in rural and urban settlements using boosting additive quantile models. The models are estimated using a cross-sectional dataset containing information of more that 50 thousand households for the year 2015. The main results highlight the importance of analyzing poverty from an individual, household, community and regional perspectives and the relevance of accounting for heterogeneity of the effects on female- and male-headed households. The results point towards the existence of a life-income cycle and the relevance of education, social networks, income equality and quality of government to fight poverty. The findings also indicate that economic empowerment of women matters for pro-poor income policies to be effective and point towards the need of introducing a gender approach in the study on poverty.\n\n\nCitation\n\nTorres Munguía, Juan Armando; Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada (2020).

It is based on data collected in multiple qualitative and quantitative studies across the Lake Chad Region conducted from May 2021 through June 2022. The findings provide an insight into the expectations and experiences of child exits from armed groups, the reintegration support provided, community and family acceptance, and the risk of re-recruitment and continued engagement after exiting an armed group. Such knowledge has the potential to strengthen interventions that support children after they leave armed groups and re-enter civilian life, and to ensure that programming accounts for the unique needs of children.\n\n\nCitation\n\nvan Broeckhoven, Kato; O’Neil, Siobhan; Punton, Niamh; Torres Munguía, Juan Armando; Yetcha Ajimi, Fatima; Bukar, Mohammed; Madhuraj, Anamika (2023).

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe purpose of this paper is to identify the risk factors for emotional intimate partner violence (IPV) against women and girls with children in Mexico from an ecological perspective. To that end, we generate a dataset with 35,004 observations and 42 covariates, to which we apply an additive probit model estimated with a boosting algorithm to overcome high-dimensionality and simultaneously perform variable selection and model choice. The dataset integrates 10 information sources, allowing us to properly characterize the four levels of the ecological approach, which is the first contribution of this paper. In addition, there are three key contributions. First, we identify a number of factors significantly linked to emotional IPV against women with children: age, age at sexual initiation, age at marriage (or cohabitation), autonomy regarding professional issues, social support networks, division of housework, the community’s Gini index, women’s economic participation in the municipality, and the prevalence of crime against males in the region. Second, we discuss some risk factors whose effects have not been examined or have been underexplored for Mexico; these include women’s decision-making autonomy, social support networks, distribution of housework, the community’s economic inequality, and criminality. Third, we identify specific risk subgroups that are generally overlooked: women who had their first sexual intercourse during childhood and women who got married (or moved in together with a partner) late in life. The main results suggest that strategies aiming to promote women’s social and economic empowerment and reduce criminality should also incorporate a gender component regarding emotional violence against women with children in the context of intimate relationships.\n\n\nCitation\n\nTorres Munguía, Juan Armando; Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada (2022).

    "text": "Abstract\nThe goal of this study was to identify and describe the extent to which a comprehensive set of risk factors from the ecological model are associated with physical intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization in Mexico. To achieve this goal, a structured additive probit model is applied to a dataset of 35,000 observations and 42 theoretical correlates from 10 data sources. Due to the model’s high dimensionality, the boosting algorithm is used for estimating and simultaneously performing variable selection and model choice. The findings indicate that age at sexual initiation and marriage, sexual and professional autonomy, social connectedness, household overcrowding, housework division, women’s political participation, and geographical space are associated with physical IPV. The findings provide evidence of risk factors that were previously unknown in Mexico or were solely based on theoretical grounds without empirical testing. Specifically, this paper makes three key contributions. First, by examining the individual and relationship levels, it was possible to identify high-risk population subgroups that are often overlooked, such as women who experienced sexual initiation during childhood and women living in overcrowded families. Second, the inclusion of community factors enabled the identification of the importance of promoting women’s political participation. Finally, the introduction of several emerging indicators allowed to examine the experiences faced by women in various aspects of life, such as decision-making power, social networks, and the division of housework.\n\n\nCitation\n\nTorres Munguía, Juan Armando (2024).

    "title": "Examining gender inequalities in factors associated with income poverty in Mexican rural households",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nAccording to 2016 official estimates, almost 60 percent of the rural population in Mexico (16.9 million people) had income levels below the poverty line, and approximately 29.2 percent (8.3 million) could not even afford the basic food basket. Whereas most poverty research disregards gender and exclusively analyzes average income or the expected probability of being poor, we depart from these approaches by examining the effect of potential risk factors on two of the lowest quantiles of income-to-poverty ratio distribution, namely the corresponding to poor and extremely poor families. Focusing on identifying heterogeneous effects according to the sex of the household head, we apply additive quantile models to a cross-sectional dataset containing information on 4,434 women-headed and 14,877 men-headed households. For each model, we introduce 45 variables at the individual/household, community, and regional levels. Two major contributions emerge from this paper. First, the identification of a subset of significant factors whose effect is independent of the head’s sex and is relevant for poor and extremely poor families. This is found for the variables credit card ownership, access to basic housing services, education level, and satisfaction with public services. Second, results also identify a subset of significant factors with an uneven effect on income according to the sex of the head that is observed both in the poor and extremely poor households. Variables having this gendered effect are the community’s income inequality, municipal human development, social networks, access to social security, and gender-based violence against women in the public sphere. Out of these, particularly relevant is the effect of the last three factors, whose association with income has not been explored before for rural Mexico and for which the bias among sexes increases as family income grows from extreme poverty to poverty level.\n\n\nCitation\n\nTorres Munguía, Juan Armando; Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada (2021).

Then the performance of six methods for addressing missingness is evaluated: listwise, mode imputation, random imputation, hot-deck, imputation by polytomous regression and random forests.

The file’s name changes according to the last update, having a pattern beginning with the prefix “outbreaks_”, followed by the date of last update. For instance, for the version updated on September 30, 2024, the corresponding .csv file is outbreaks_30092024.csv.\n\n# Define the GitHub raw content URL\nurl_api &lt;- \"https://api.github.com/repos/jatorresmunguia/disease_outbreak_news/contents/Last%20update\"\nlast_file &lt;- fromJSON(content(GET(url_api), as = \"text\"))$name[grepl(fromJSON(content(GET(url_api), as = \"text\"))$name, pattern = paste0(\"^outbreaks\"))]\n\nrdata_file &lt;- last_file[grepl(\".csv$\", last_file)]\nfile_name &lt;- basename(rdata_file)\ndate_string &lt;- sub(\".*_(\\\\d{2})(\\\\d{2})(\\\\d{4}).*\", \"\\\\1-\\\\2-\\\\3\", file_name)\ndate_obj &lt;- dmy(date_string)\n\nformatted_date &lt;- format(date_obj, \"%d/%m/%Y\")  \nformatted_month &lt;- format(date_obj, \"%B %d, %Y\")     \n\noutbreaks &lt;- read.csv(paste0(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jatorresmunguia/disease_outbreak_news/refs/heads/main/Last%20update\", \"/\", rdata_file),\n                      header = TRUE)\n\n# Ensure no extra blanks in country names\noutbreaks &lt;- outbreaks |&gt;\n  mutate(across(c(icd104n, iso3, Country), \n                ~ factor(str_squish(as.character(.)))))\n\n\n\nStep 3: Load geospatial data\nTo produce the choropleth maps, it is required to get the country administrative boundaries from a geospatial object. In this tutorial, the shapefile located in our GitHub is used.\n\n# URL for the ZIP file containing the shapefile (administrative boundaries)\nurl_shp &lt;- \"/vsicurl/https://github.com/jatorresmunguia/outbreaks_dashboard/raw/main/Data/shp_outbreaks.shp\"\n\nshpsf &lt;- st_read(url_shp, quiet = TRUE)\n\n\n\nStep 4: Reshape the data\nHere, we summarize the outbreaks data by iso3 code, year, and disease, and calculate the total number of outbreaks per country, and reshape to long format.\n\nshpsf_unique &lt;- shpsf |&gt; \n  st_drop_geometry() |&gt;\n  distinct(iso3, .keep_all = TRUE)\n\noutbreaks &lt;- shpsf_unique |&gt;\n  select(iso3, continent) |&gt;\n  right_join(outbreaks, by = \"iso3\") \n\ndata_base &lt;- outbreaks |&gt; \n  # Group the data\n  group_by(iso3, Year, icd104n) |&gt; \n  # Summarize the number of outbreaks\n  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop') |&gt; \n  # Reshape to wide format\n  pivot_wider(names_from = icd104n, values_from = count, values_fill = 0) \n\ndata_base &lt;- data_base |&gt; \n  # Replace missing values (NA) with 0\n  mutate(across(-c(iso3, Year), ~replace(., is.na(.), 0))) |&gt; \n  # Calculate the total outbreaks per country\n  mutate(`All diseases` = rowSums(across(-c(iso3, Year)))) |&gt; \n  # Reshape to long format\n  pivot_longer(!c(iso3, Year), names_to = \"Disease\", values_to = \"outbreaks\") \n\n\n\nStep 5: Add the geographic attributes to the outbreaks data\nAfter loading the shapefile containing the administrative boundaries for countries, we need to integrate this geographic information into the disease outbreaks data. To do this, we have to merge the data_base object with the shpsf using iso3 country codes as key variable.\n\noutbreaks_all &lt;- data_base |&gt; \n  # Filter the data to include only the \"All diseases\" category, which represents the total number of outbreaks per country.\n  # Here, you can also select a particular disease\n  filter(Disease == \"All diseases\") |&gt; \n  # Group the data by country code (iso3) and summarize the total number of outbreaks for each country.\n  group_by(iso3) |&gt; \n  summarise(outbreaks = sum(outbreaks)) |&gt; \n  # Perform a right join with the spatial data (`shpsf`) to combine the outbreak data with geographical boundaries.\n  right_join(shpsf, by = \"iso3\") |&gt; \n  # Convert the resulting data into a spatial data frame using `st_as_sf()` to prepare for mapping.\n  mutate(outbreaks = replace_na(outbreaks, 0)) |&gt;\n  st_as_sf()\n\nNote: You can also use filter(between(Year, left = , right = )) to exclusively include a subset of observations by specifying a date range. For example, setting left = 2010 and right = 2020 would filter the data to only include outbreaks that occurred between 2010 and 2020. This is useful when you want to focus on a specific time period within your dataset.\n\n\nStep 6: Making the interactive map\nTo create the interactive choropleth map using leaflet library, we first set up a palette to categorize the number of outbreaks into bins, which is essential for visual differentiation on the choropleth map.\n\n# Define the color palette with bins for categorizing outbreak numbers\nmybins &lt;- c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70)\nmypalette &lt;- colorBin(palette = \"PuRd\", \n                      domain = outbreaks_all$outbreaks,\n                      na.color = \"transparent\", bins = mybins)\n\nThen, we create labels to display the country name and the number of outbreaks when hovering over the choropleth map.\n\n# Create labels for each country\nmytext &lt;- paste0(\"&lt;b&gt;\", outbreaks_all$Country, \"&lt;/b&gt;\", \"&lt;br/&gt;\",\n                outbreaks_all$outbreaks, \" \", \"outbreaks\"\n                ) |&gt; \n  lapply(htmltools::HTML)\n\nAdd a title for the map\n\n# Add map title\ntag.map.title &lt;- tags$style(HTML(\"\n  .leaflet-control.map-title { \n    left: 50%;  \n    transform: translateX(-50%);\n    text-align: left;\n    padding-left: 10px; \n    padding-right: 10px; \n    background: rgba(255,255,255,0.75);\n    font-weight: bold;\n    font-size: 20px;\n    color: black;\n  }\n\"))\n\n# Create the map\ntitle &lt;- tags$div(\n  tag.map.title, HTML(\"Geographic distribution of disease outbreaks, Jan 1996-Sep 2024\")\n)\n\nFinally, we set up the Leaflet map with tiles, polygons, labels, a legend, and a title.\nleaflet(outbreaks_all, options = leafletOptions(zoomControl = FALSE)) |&gt;\n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldTopoMap) |&gt;\n  setView(lat = 10, lng = 0, zoom = 2) |&gt;\n  # Add polygons for countries and their outbreak data\n  addPolygons(\n    fillColor = ~mypalette(outbreaks),\n    stroke = TRUE,\n    fillOpacity = 0.9,\n    color = \"white\",\n    weight = 0.3,\n    label = mytext,\n    labelOptions = labelOptions(\n      style = list(\"font-weight\" = \"normal\", padding = \"3px 8px\"),\n      textsize = \"13px\",\n      direction = \"auto\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  # Add a legend to explain the color scale\n  addLegend(\n    pal = mypalette, values = ~outbreaks, opacity = 0.9,\n    title = \"Number of outbreaks:\",\n    position = \"bottomleft\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  # Add the title to the map\n  addControl(title, position = \"topleft\", className = \"map-title\") |&gt;\n  # Re-add the zoom control to the top-right corner\n  onRender(\"function(el, x) {\n          L.control.zoom({position:'topright'}).addTo(this);\n          }\")\n\n\nNote: You can add card(full_screen = TRUE) from bslib library to add an icon to expand the card’s size to the browser window."

Additionally, I have contributed to the design of surveys assessing the socioeconomic conditions of both displaced and non-displaced households in Sudan, as well as the experiences of individuals and families before, during, and after armed conflicts in Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon, and Iraq.\nExample:\nI helped organize the sampling design for the first national victimization survey of Panama Read the document (only in Spanish).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData management\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more +\n\n\n\n\n\nTasks include:\n\nIdentification of data sources;\nGathering data from various sources;\nCleaning, structuring, and transforming messy data into research-ready datasets; and,\nOrganizing and storing data.\n\nExperience:\nI have experience in data cleaning, as well as creating data dictionaries and metadata. Additionally, I have worked on integrating data from household surveys, administrative records, censuses, and remote sensing sources. When statistical information is unavailable, I have leveraged LLMs, web scraping, and text and data mining techniques to generate new datasets.\nExample:\nI am the author of the global dataset of pandemic- and epidemic-prone disease outbreaks, which earned the 2023 ENLIGHT Open Science Award and was a finalist for the Falling Walls Science Breakthroughs in Science & Innovation Management.\nAdditionally, I led the data management and analysis of a survey conducted in 2022 across four key locations in Iraq previously occupied by ISIL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more +\n\n\n\n\n\nTasks include:\n\nLinear regression and nonlinear regression modeling;\nMachine learning predictive modelling;\nDisaggregated analyses; and,\nStatistical tests to assess differences between populations.\n\nExperience:\nI have experience analyzing and interpreting data on victimization, gender-based violence, food security, income poverty, displacement, and armed conflict. Additionally, I have also developed and examined hard-to-measure phenomena such as indicators for severity assessments and perception of social networks.\nExample:\nAt UNIDIR, I analyzed and co-authored five research papers on subjects such as weapon holding, child recruitment, and family reintegration in Iraq.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData visualization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more +\n\n\n\n\n\nTasks include:\n\nBuilding dynamic and interactive dashboards; and,\nCustom data visualizations.\n\nExperience:\nI have experience developing dynamic R Shiny dashboards and creating interactive visualizations using ggplot2, tidyplots, and Leaflet. My work includes designing choropleth maps and tailored data visualizations for reports, presentations, and academic publications.\nExample:\nGo to the Shiny Dashboard of the DISEASE OUTBREAKS DATA project.\nAt IOM, I contributed to developing a PowerBI interactive dashboard for migration governance in Mesoamerica and the Caribbean."

The dataset contains information on 70 infectious diseases and 2227 public health events that occurred over the period from January 1996 to March 2022 in 233 countries and territories around the world. We illustrate the potential use of this dataset to the research community by analysing the spatial distribution of disease outbreaks. We find evidence of spatial clusters of high incidences hot spots in Africa, America, and Asia. This spatial analysis enables policymakers to identify the regions with the greatest likelihood of suffering from disease outbreaks and, taking into account their degree of preparedness and vulnerability, to develop policies that may help contain the spreading of future outbreaks. Further applications could focus on combining our data with other information sources to study, for instance, the link between environmental, globalization, and/or socioeconomic factors with disease outbreaks.\n\n\nCitation\n\nTorres Munguía, Juan Armando; Badarau, Florina Cristina; Díaz Pavez, Luis Rodrigo; Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada; Wacker, Konstantin M.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper aims to identify income-poverty risk factors in urban Mexican households. Special emphasis is paid to examine differences between female- and male-headed families. To this, a dataset with 45 theoretical factors at the individual/household, community, and regional levels, integrating information from nine sources, is created. To these data, additive quantile models are estimated via the boosting algorithm. From a gender standpoint, the following main contributions come from this paper. First, educational lag is particularly relevant for female-headed households. Second, there is a gendered life cycle in the income trajectory for poor households with a head having a medium level of education. Third, some households, traditionally disregarded, are found to be even poorer: those lacking social connectedness, without credit cards, with an extended composition, in which the female head spends a large part of her time on housework, and families headed by young women with a medium level of education. Finally, communities and regions where families have a lower income-to-poverty ratio are characterized as having an unequal income distribution, lower human development, lower levels of women’s economic participation, poor quality of services, and lower gender-based violence levels in the public sphere but higher gender-based violence levels in the family context.\n\n\nCitation\n\nTorres Munguía, Juan (2024).

    "text": "Abstract\nThe goal of this study is to identify the extent to which a set of risk factors from the ecological model are associated with intimate partner sexual violence victimisation in Mexico. To achieve this goal, a structured additive probit model is applied to a dataset of 35,004 observations and 42 correlates. Findings indicate that age at sexual initiation, women’s sexual and professional autonomy, and social connectedness are associated with their victimisation risks. The findings provide evidence of factors that were previously unknown in Mexico or were solely based on theory but lacking empirical analysis. There are four key contributions. First, findings indicate that factors closer to the individual, such as personal experiences and interpersonal relationships, are more influential in explaining the women’s risks of IPSV victimisation. Second, significant factors were identified, including age at first sexual intercourse, autonomy in sexual and professional decision-making, and social networks. Third, it was possible to identify high-risk population subgroups that are often overlooked, such as women who had their sexual initiation during childhood. Finally, the introduction of some emerging indicators allowed for the examination of the experiences faced by women in various aspects of life, such as decision-making power and social networks.\n\n\nCitation\n\nTorres Munguía, Juan Armando (2024).

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nFrom 1990 to 2016, more than 425,000 homicides have occurred in Mexico. In 2016, the country recorded the world’s second largest number of conflict fatalities with more than 24,000 killings. Despite the growing attention for inquiring into specific causes of homicide victimization, research on the matter suffer from three important shortcomings: disregard for introducing a gender perspective, lack of a multilevel approach -use of information both at the victim and community levels- and the exclusive use of traditional linear models -failing to capture nonlinear relationships, as can be expected, in the linkage between age of a person and their likelihood of being victim of crime-. In order to contribute to the analysis of homicides in Mexico, the present study develops a semiparametric approach to investigate the determinants of gender bias in homicide victimization in Mexico. Homicide statistics from 2010 to 2014 and 2010 census data are used to construct a logistic model with sex of the victim as response variable and a set of potential categorical and continuous covariates. The main results suggest that gender differences in victimization can be explained by the mechanism of killing, interaction between age of the victim and the killing mechanism, social deprivation of the municipality of occurrence, share of the population living in female-headed households, share of the population living in indigenous-headed households, random effects and spatial effects.\n\n\n\nCitation\n\nTorres Munguía, Juan Armando; Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada (2018).

    "text": "Abstract\nThis report is based on data collected from June to July 2022 from a total of 1,882 respondents collected in four key locations, each of which was occupied by ISIL: Al Qaim (Anbar governorate), Habaniyya (Anbar governorate), Tooz (Salah al-Din governorate), and Muhalabiya (Nineveh governorate). The sample was divided into two roughly equal halves: those who had benefited from UNDP support (810 persons or 43 per cent) and a randomized household sample from the same areas (1,072 persons or 57 per cent). In addition, qualitative interviews were carried out in the same four locations between July and November 2022 with key stakeholders (local authorities, tribal leaders, mukhtars) as well as 60 survey respondents to explore the survey findings in greater depth. The four locations were chosen because they are the sites of community-based reconciliation and reintegration programming delivered by UNDP Iraq. Amongst other objectives, the programmes seek to support the return and reintegration of families perceived as having ISIL affiliation and to support the communities that receive them. The report ends with an examination of key policy and programmatic implications of these findings. The report presents data about community experiences pre-, during, and post-war, and examines what community experiences, perceptions, and preferences mean for reintegration prospects for those families perceived as having ISIL affiliation. This data may be useful to UN and NGO partners working in the region to bolster their early recovery programming, as well as efforts to support reintegration, community reconciliation, and broader peacebuilding efforts. The report ends with an examination of key policy and programmatic implications of these findings.\n\n\nCitation\n\nParry, Jacqueline; Khoshnaw, Yousif Khalid; O’Neil, Siobhan; Torres Munguía, Juan Armando (2023).

Specifically, the study set out to compare the answers to a set of five questions on drug use, victimization experiences, and social connectedness with the Boko Haram armed group between interviews conducted by phone and those administered face-to-face with an enumerator. The data comes from a survey carried out between May 2021 and early June 2022 (amid the COVID-29 health crisis) in the Maiduguri Metropolitan area and the communities of Jere and Kodunga, in Borno State, Nigeria, a region hard hit by the Boko Haram insurgency. This report provides empirical evidence on the potential for utilizing remote assessment of UN-supported programmes in insecure and/or inaccessible areas. This report examines what works to overcome methodological challenges in remote data collection in the context of armed conflict, specifically by identifying the specific roll-out practices that appear to bolster responses.\n\n\nCitation\n\nTorres Munguía, Juan Armando; Bukar, Mohammed; Yetcha Ajimi, Fatima; O’Neil, Siobhan; van Broeckhoven, Kato (2023).

    "text": "Abstract\nIn the last two decades, Latin America has been describes as an unsafe and violent region. Nonetheless, such picture is mostly based on homicide rates. Even though homicide is considered the best recorded crime, it does not provide full account of other forms of violent crime. Moreover, a great deal of research on crime throughout the region tends to be descriptive and anecdotal. Misunderstanding the causes of crime and disregarding evidence might induce policy makers to implement ineffective strategies, particularly at the local level. Therefore, based on Social Disorganization Theory, this study explains violent crime across and within selected cities of Latin America.\n\n\nCitation\n\nVilalta Perdomo, Carlos J.; Castillo, José G.; Torres Munguía, Juan Armando (2016).

    "text": "Abstract\n\nReporting on and monitoring epidemics is a public health priority. Several initiatives and platforms provide epidemiological data, such as the EM-DAT International Disaster Database, which has 1525 epidemics and their impact reported since 1900, including 892 epidemics between 2000 and 2023. However, EM-DAT has inconsistent coverage and deficiencies regarding the systematic monitoring of epidemics data due to the lack of a standardized methodology to define what will be included under an epidemic disaster. We conducted a sequential study that included an online survey of experts in infectious diseases, public health emergencies, and related data, followed by committee discussions with disaster experts. This approach aimed to identify appropriate definitions and entry criteria for archiving disease outbreak events. The survey had 21 respondents from universities and international organizations, with experts primarily specialized in infectious disease surveillance. Experts agreed that epidemics should be considered as disasters. Experts cited challenges in defining epidemic thresholds. However, they proposed pathogen-based criteria and agreed that disruption to society, especially to the healthcare system, serves as a determinant of epidemic disasters. The experts favored deaths and confirmed cases as key indicators, alongside suggestions on refining EM-DAT’s entry criteria and improving epidemic impact assessment. This article offers valuable insights into epidemic disasters, a topic previously underdefined in the literature, thereby enhancing understanding for policymakers and public health professionals.\n\n\nCitation\n\nTonnelier, Margo; Delforge, Damien; Below, Regina; Munguía, Juan Armando Torres; Saegerman, Claude; Wathelet, Valentin; van Loenhout, Joris A.
