## Overview
In this article, I will guide you through the process of analyzing Mexico's 2024 National Survey of Victimization and Perception of Public Safety (_Encuesta Nacional de Victimización y Percepción sobre Seguridad Pública_, ENVIPE) using the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) framework for survey analysis with the `srvyr` package. Specifically, we will calculate the **crime prevalence rate per 100,000 inhabitants by state, according to the victim's sex** ( _Tasa de prevalencia delictiva por entidad federativa por cada cien mil habitantes, según sexo de la víctima_).

Official tables with this indicator can be found [here](https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/envipe/2024/#tabulados).

By the end of this article, you will be able to use the `tidyverse` to:

- Load the survey microdata from INEGI's website.
- Specify the ENVIPE survey design.
- Calculate crime prevalence indicators.

## About the ENVIPE
ENVIPE is an official survey that provides nationally and state-representative information on household crime victimization and perceptions of public safety in Mexico. Conducted annually since 2011 by the [National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI)](https://www.inegi.org.mx/default.html), ENVIPE collects data on the following crimes:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Total vehicle theft (car, pickup truck, or truck).
- Theft of vehicle accessories, spare parts, or tools (car, pickup truck, or truck).
- Wall graffiti, intentional vehicle damage, and other types of vandalism.
- Burglary or attempted burglary.
- Kidnapping.
- Enforced disappearance.
- Homicide.
- Robbery or assault on the street or public transportation.

:::
  
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Theft in a manner different from the above.
- Bank fraud.
- Consumer fraud.
- Extortion.
- Threats.
- Injuries.
- Kidnapping.
- Harassment or intimidation.
- Groping.
- Exhibitionism.
- Attempted rape.
- Sexual rape.
- Other crimes.

All survey-related information, including questionnaires, methodology, glossaries, summaries, and microdata, is fully available at [INEGI's website](https://en.www.inegi.org.mx/programas/envipe/2024/).

## Set-up
First, install and load the required packages:

```{r}
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse) # Tidy data analysis framework
library(srvyr) # Tidy syntax for survey data analysis
library(archive) # Extract files from a ZIP archive
library(kableExtra) # Create HTML table

```

## Loading survey microdata from INEGI
Microdata is available [here](https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/envipe/2024/#microdatos) in various formats (CSV, DBF, DTA, SAV, and RData). In this post, we will use the RData files.

```{r}

load(archive_read(
  archive = "https://www.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/programas/envipe/2024/microdatos/bd_envipe_2024_RData.zip",
  file = "BD_ENVIPE_2024.RData"
))

```

::: {.callout-tip}

Using the `archive` package, we can directly extract the required file from `bd_envipe_2024_RData.zip`. 

:::

This loads the following objects into the global environment:

- `THogar`: This object contains the interview result, the row of the selected respondent, the household factor, and other household characteristics.

- `TMod_Vic`: This object includes information on the crimes suffered by the selected respondent and their household during the reference year, specifically during 2023. Information comes from the victimization module of the survey.

- `TPer_Vic1`: This object includes information related to the perception of public security within the respondent’s geographic area, antisocial behaviors in their immediate surroundings, and changes in habits due to fear of becoming a crime victim in 2023. Additionally, it presents information regarding the performance of authorities and trust in them. In other words, this table covers Sections IV and V of the main questionnaire.

- `TPer_Vic2`: This object consolidates information related to household and personal victimization, particularly focusing on high-impact crimes experienced by the household (such as kidnapping, enforced disappearance, or homicide) or by the selected respondent. This table includes Sections VI and VII of the main questionnaire.

- `TSDem`: This object contains the socio-demographic characteristics of household members, corresponding to Section III of the main questionnaire.

- `TSVivienda`: This object contains the characteristics of the households captured through the questionnaire cover page, as well as the count of household residents and the number of households. In other words, it includes Sections I and II of the main questionnaire.

## Calculating crime prevalence rate per 100,000 thousand inhabitants by state, according to the victim's sex
To estimate the crime prevalence rate, we use information from `TPer_Vic2` (screening questions on victimization from the main questionnaire) and `TMod_Vic` (specific victimization module applied to the respondents who reported being a victim of at least one of the crimes included in the survey during the reference period). `TPer_Vic2` will serve to characterize the total population and `TMod_Vic` to describe the victims and the associated crimes. 

### 1. Specifying the ENVIPE survey design
ENVIPE follows a probabilistic, three-stage, stratified, and clustered sampling design. The sampling unit is the household, while the unit of analysis is the population aged 18 and older in selected households. More details on the sampling design can be found [here](https://www.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/productos/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/nueva_estruc/889463920014.pdf)(in Spanish).

From the documentation on [data structure](https://www.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/programas/envipe/2024/doc/fd_envipe2024.pdf)(in Spanish), the key variables for specifying the survey design are:

- `ID_PER`: Person identifier

- `EST_DIS`: Stratum

- `UPM_DIS`: Primary sampling unit

- `FAC_ELE`: Weighting factor for public security perception and victimization estimates.

We specify the survey design as follows:

```{r}

# Identify victims from TMod_Vic, excluding 
# "Wall graffiti, intentional vehicle damage, and other vandalism" (BPCOD != "03")
id_victims <- TMod_Vic |>
  filter(BPCOD != "03") |>
  pull(ID_PER)

# Create victimization variable in TPer_Vic2
TPer_Vic2 <- TPer_Vic2 |>
  mutate(victimization = ifelse(ID_PER %in% id_victims, 1, 0))

# Convert FAC_ELE (weights) to numeric
TPer_Vic2 <- TPer_Vic2 |>
  mutate(FAC_ELE = as.numeric(FAC_ELE))

# Label SEXO variable
TPer_Vic2 <- TPer_Vic2 |>
  mutate(SEXO = recode(SEXO, "1" = "Man", "2" = "Woman"))

# Create survey object
envipe_design <- TPer_Vic2 |>
  as_survey_design(
    weights = FAC_ELE, # Weights (inverse probability)
    strata = EST_DIS, # Stratum
    ids = UPM_DIS, # Primary sampling unit
    nest = TRUE # Nesting within strata
  )

```

### 2. Calculating point estimates and variablity indicators
To compute proportions from survey data, we use `survey_mean()` from `srvyr` package. From ENVIPE's documentation, we know that `NOM_ENT` represents the state, while `SEXO` corresponds to the respondent's sex.

```{r}
#| results: hide

envipe_design |>
  # `interact` function is used to calculate the proportion 
  # over the interaction of state and sex
  group_by(interact(NOM_ENT, SEXO)) |>
  summarize(
    Proportion = survey_mean(victimization,
      level = 0.90, # Confidence level
      vartype = c("se", "ci", "cv") # Variability indicators
    )
  ) |>
  ungroup() |>
  mutate(
    `Prevalence rate` = Proportion * 100000, # Rate per 100,000 people
    `Standard error` = Proportion_se * 100000,
    `Low 90% CI` = Proportion_low * 100000,
    `Upper 90% CI` = Proportion_upp * 100000,
    `Coefficient of variation %` = Proportion_cv * 100,
    State = str_to_sentence(NOM_ENT) # Capitalize only the first letter
  ) |>
  rename(Sex = SEXO) |>
  select(State, Sex, `Prevalence rate`, `Standard error`, 
         `Low 90% CI`, `Upper 90% CI`, `Coefficient of variation %`) |>
  kbl() |> # HTML table
  kable_styling() # Apply bootstrap theme to the table
  
```

The output table looks like this: 
```{r}
#| echo: false

envipe_design |>
  # `interact` function is used to calculate the proportion 
  # over the interaction of state and sex
  group_by(interact(NOM_ENT, SEXO)) |>
  summarize(
    Proportion = survey_mean(victimization,
      level = 0.90, # Confidence level
      vartype = c("se", "ci", "cv") # Variability indicators
    )
  ) |>
  ungroup() |>
  mutate(
    `Prevalence rate` = Proportion * 100000, # Rate per 100,000 people
    `Standard error` = Proportion_se * 100000,
    `Low 90% CI` = Proportion_low * 100000,
    `Upper 90% CI` = Proportion_upp * 100000,
    `Coefficient of variation %` = Proportion_cv * 100,
    State = str_to_title(NOM_ENT) # Capitalize each word
  ) |>
  rename(Sex = SEXO) |>
  select(State, Sex, `Prevalence rate`, `Standard error`, 
         `Low 90% CI`, `Upper 90% CI`, `Coefficient of variation %`) |>
  kbl() |> # HTML table
  kable_styling() # Apply bootstrap theme to the table
  
```
