**Tasks include:**
  
- Defining objectives,
- Identifying the target population,
- Designing indicators,
- Developing survey questionnaires, and
- Planning the sampling design.

**Experience:**
  
I have experience working with questionnaires on victimization experiences and perceptions of insecurity across various Latin American countries, surveys assessing the socioeconomic conditions of both displaced and non-displaced households in Sudan, as well as the experiences of individuals and families before, during, and after armed conflicts in Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon, and Iraq.

**Example:**
  
I helped organize the sampling design for the first national victimization survey of Panama [Read the document (only in Spanish)](https://siec.minseg.gob.pa/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Diseno-Muestral-de-la-ENVIP-2015.pdf).

**Tasks include:**
  
- Identification of data sources; 
- Gathering data from various sources;
- Cleaning, structuring, and transforming messy data into research-ready datasets; and,
- Organizing and storing data.

**Experience:**
  
I have experience in data cleaning, as well as creating data dictionaries and metadata. Additionally, I have worked on integrating data from household surveys, administrative records, censuses, and remote sensing sources. When statistical information is unavailable, I have leveraged LLMs, web scraping, and text and data mining techniques to generate new datasets.

**Example:**

I am the author of the [global dataset of pandemic- and epidemic-prone disease outbreaks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01797-2), which earned the 2023 ENLIGHT Open Science Award and was a finalist for the Falling Walls Science Breakthroughs in Science & Innovation Management. 

Additionally, I led the data management and analysis of a survey conducted in 2022 across four key locations in Iraq previously occupied by ISIL.

**Tasks include:**
  
- Linear regression and nonlinear regression modeling;
- Machine learning predictive modelling;
- Disaggregated analyses; and,
- Statistical tests to assess differences between populations. 

**Experience:**

I have experience analyzing and interpreting data on victimization, gender-based violence, food security, income poverty, displacement, and armed conflict. Additionally, I have also developed and examined hard-to-measure phenomena such as indicators for severity assessments and perception of social networks.

**Example:**

I have co-authored five research papers on subjects such as [weapon holding](https://unidir.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/UNIDIR_Factors_Driving_Weapons_Holding_in_the_North_East_of_Nigeria_MEAC_Findings_Report_33.pdf), [child recruitment](https://unidir.org/publication/child-recruitment-in-the-lake-chad-basin-findings-report-22/), and [family reintegration in Iraq](https://unidir.org/publication/coming-home-the-return-and-reintegration-of-families-with-perceived-isil-affiliation-in-iraq-findings-report-28/).

**Tasks include:**
  
- Building dynamic and interactive dashboards; and,
- Custom data visualizations.

**Experience:** 

I have experience developing dynamic R Shiny dashboards and creating interactive visualizations using ggplot2, tidyplots, and Leaflet. My work includes designing choropleth maps and tailored data visualizations for reports, presentations, and academic publications.

**Example:**

Go to the [Shiny Dashboard of the DISEASE OUTBREAKS DATA project](https://jatorresmunguia.shinyapps.io/A_global_dataset_of_disease_outbreaks/).

At IOM, I contributed to developing a [PowerBI interactive dashboard for migration governance in Mesoamerica and the Caribbean](https://rosanjose.iom.int/en/interactive-dashboard-governance-migration-mesoamerica-and-caribbean).
